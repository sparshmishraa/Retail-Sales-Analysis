# Retail Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
   This project focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a sample Superstore dataset using Microsoft Excel and Tableau. The analysis aims to identify weak areas in sales performance and uncover where the 
   company is incurring the most significant losses through discounts.

## Objectives
   1. Identify and highlight low-performing areas in sales across different dimensions, such as regions, categories, and sub-categories.
   2. Determine where the company is losing the most money due to excessive discounts.
   3. Provide actionable insights to improve sales performance and profitability.

## Tools Used
   1. Microsoft Excel:
      Used for initial data cleaning, formatting, and preparation.
   2. Tableau:
      Employed to create visualizations and dashboards for insightful analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process
   To ensure data quality and consistency, Microsoft Excel was used for data cleaning. The following steps were performed:
   
   1. Checking for Blank Rows:
      The dataset was reviewed for missing rows or blank entries.
      Result: No blank rows were identified.
   
   2. Checking for Duplicate Records:
      The dataset was examined for duplicate entries that could skew the analysis.
      Result: 17 duplicate records were found and removed, resulting in a cleaner and more accurate dataset.

   3. Grammar and Spelling Errors:
      All textual entries were checked for errors to maintain clarity and consistency.
      Result: No grammar or spelling errors were found.

   4. Formatting Consistency:
      Ensured that all columns, such as numerical data, dates, and categorical entries, were formatted consistently.
      Result: All columns were properly formatted.
   
   The data cleaning process ensured the dataset was ready for accurate analysis and reporting.

## Key Insights
   After performing EDA using Tableau and Excel, the following insights were uncovered:
  
   1. Low-Performing Sub-Categories:
      Certain sub-categories, such as fasteners, envelopes, cards, and art supplies, were identified as the lowest-performing in terms of sales.

   2. Sales by Segment:
      The Home Office and Corporate segments reported the lowest sales quantities within their respective categories.

   3. Regional Sales Performance:
      The Central region demonstrated the weakest sales performance, followed by the South region.

   4. Category Sales Performance:
      The Office Supplies category had the lowest sales share, contributing only 31.101% to overall sales.

   5. State Sales Performance:
      Among the states, North Dakota recorded the lowest sales, followed by Maine and South Dakota.


## Next Steps
   
   1. Focus on Low-Performing Sub-Categories:
   -- Investigate potential reasons for the low performance of fasteners, envelopes, cards, and art supplies.
   -- Develop targeted marketing strategies or bundle offers to boost sales in these sub-categories.

   2. Optimize Discounts:
   -- Analyze the discounting patterns to identify areas of excessive discounting and explore strategies to minimize losses.

   3. Improve Regional Performance:
   -- Conduct a deeper analysis into the Central and South regions to identify potential operational or market challenges.

   4. Enhance Sales in Low-Performing States:
   -- Collaborate with local teams to implement state-specific campaigns aimed at boosting sales in North Dakota, Maine, and South Dakota.

   By addressing these areas, the company can achieve better sales performance and profitability.
