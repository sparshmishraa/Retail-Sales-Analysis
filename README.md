# Retail-Sales-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of a sample Superstore dataset using excel and tableau

## Objective:

1. Identifying and highlighting weak areas in sales

2. Determining where the company is losing the most money through discounts

## Data Cleaning: 

I've used microsoft excel for this task.

The primary goal was to ensure data quality and consistency, enabling accurate analysis and reporting.

Steps:

1. Checking for Blank Rows: No blank rows were found.

2. Checking for Duplicates: 17 duplicate records were found and deleted, resulting in a cleaner      dataset.

3. Checking for Grammar and Spelling Errors: No grammar or spelling errors were found.

4. Checking for Formatting Consistency: All columns were found to be consistently formatted.

## Insights: 

Here are the key insights I gathered:

1. Low-Performing Sub-Categories: Our analysis reveals that the sub-categories including fasteners, envelopes, cards, and art supplies are the lowest performing in terms of sales.

2. Sales by Segment: The Home Office and Corporate segments have the lowest sales quantities within their respective categories.

3. Regional Sales Performance: The Central region has the lowest sales, followed by the South.

4. Category Sales Performance: Within the categories, office supplies have the lowest sales share, contributing only 31.101%.

5. State Sales Performance: Among the states, North Dakota has the lowest sales, followed by Maine and South Dakota.
