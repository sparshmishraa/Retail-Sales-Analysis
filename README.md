This retail sales analysis project focuses on exploring a Superstore dataset to identify low-performing areas and excessive discounting that lead to profitability losses. Using Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization, the analysis reveals key insights such as underperforming sub-categories (e.g., fasteners, envelopes), weak regional sales in the Central and South regions, and low sales in states like North Dakota and Maine. Additionally, the Office Supplies category and Home Office segment report the lowest contributions to overall sales. Expect actionable recommendations to improve performance, such as optimizing discount strategies, targeted marketing for low-performing products, and region-specific campaigns to enhance sales and profitability.
